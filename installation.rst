Installation
============

Download the QGIS installer from:
http://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html

Note: for windows users, there's a basic installer and an advanced one. The basic installer will be enough for most of you, but advanced GIS users may want to use the advanced installer because it will be easier to install additional features (like Esri File Geodatabase compatibility and development tools).


The basic installation should be fairly straight forward and involves a ~290MB download (for the 64bit version) or a ~340MB download (for the 32bit version). Unless you have a 32bit operating system (increasingly uncommon now) I advise that you get the 64bit version.
